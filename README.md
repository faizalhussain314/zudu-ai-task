Project Overview
This project is a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform built with Next.js, leveraging WordPress as the backend and GraphQL for data fetching. The platform includes key sections such as the header, footer, features, hero banner, and FAQ, which provide a complete user experience. The platform is also integrated with a service layer to manage communication with the WordPress backend.

Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories and files that separate concerns for clarity and maintainability:

src/: Contains the source code for the application.

components/: Contains all the reusable UI components, such as the header, footer, and sections (hero banner, features, and FAQ).

hooks/: Includes custom hooks to abstract and reuse logic across the app.

queries/: Stores GraphQL queries used for data fetching.

services/: Contains services that interact with the WordPress GraphQL API, handling data fetching and transformation.

lib/: Contains utility functions and shared helpers.

setupTests.ts: Jest setup file for configuring the testing environment.

next.config.js: Configuration for Next.js, including server-side rendering and environment variables.

jest.config.ts: Jest configuration for running unit tests.

.env.local: Environment variables, including the GraphQL endpoint and other sensitive data.

Features of the Platform
This platform offers the following key features:

Hero Banner: The hero section presents the platform’s key value proposition to users.

Features Section: A detailed section that highlights the platform’s features, offering an overview of what the service provides.

FAQ Section: A helpful section to answer common questions about the platform, its functionality, and pricing.

Header and Footer: Consistent global layout components that are reused across all pages.

Backend Integration
The platform integrates with WordPress using GraphQL to retrieve dynamic content. The GraphQL API is responsible for fetching pricing plans, features, and other content. The data is managed through service files that abstract the backend interactions, making it easy to fetch and transform the data into a usable format for the frontend.

Service Layer
The service layer manages communication with the WordPress backend, ensuring that data is fetched in an efficient and structured manner. This layer encapsulates all logic related to data fetching and provides a clear interface for retrieving data within the app.

Testing Setup
The project uses Jest for testing. Unit tests are written to validate components, services, and hooks. Jest is configured via a jest.config.ts file, and tests are located in a dedicated test folder.

Environment Variables
Sensitive data like the GraphQL endpoint and other API keys are stored in the .env.local file. These environment variables are then accessed in the application code using process.env to ensure secure management of configuration data.

Installation Guide
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://gitlink.git

cd your-repository-name

2. Install Dependencies

Once you have cloned the repository, install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

npm install

Or if you prefer yarn:

yarn install

3. Configure Environment Variables
   The project uses environment variables to manage sensitive information like the GraphQL API endpoint. Create a .env.local file in the root of the project and add the following variable:

env

NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHCQL_ENDPOINT="https://dev-zuduai-task.pantheonsite.io/graphql"

4. Running the Development Server
   Once the dependencies are installed and the environment variables are configured, start the Next.js development server:

npm run dev

Or with yarn:

yarn dev

This will start the server at http://localhost:3000. You can now open the application in your browser to see it in action.

5. Running Tests
   To run the Jest tests, use the following command:

npm run test

Or with yarn:

yarn test
This will execute all tests configured in the project.

Conclusion
This Next.js-based SaaS platform is a highly modular and maintainable solution for building a scalable and interactive platform. The project integrates with a WordPress backend using GraphQL to fetch dynamic data such as pricing plans and features. The clean structure, organized queries, and service files ensure smooth data fetching and error handling, while Jest enables unit testing for various parts of the application.

By following this structure and using the services, queries, and components properly, this project provides a solid foundation for developing and maintaining a SaaS platform with a modern tech stack.
